    <p style="text-indent:50px; font-size: 17px;">You're looking for a study technique but there's too much information coming at you. You get lost and can't help but wonder in confusion "Which is the right one for me? " Don't fret! This is a normal phenomenon. Language learning is a long strenuous process that it is no surprise if you ever get lost at the beginning and don't know where to start.
        There are 3 pieces of advice for you on how to reach Japanese fluency:
        Learn the Japanese alphabet and pronunciation: If you’re thinking about learning Japanese, the Japanese alphabet is a great starting point. This is the backbone of all Japanese learning courses. It helps you learn the basics of pronunciation in Japanese and start to understand the building blocks of the language.
        Learn the basic Kanji and vocabulary: Kanji and vocabulary require a never-ending learning process as you can come across unknown words from time to time. Hence, you should first concentrate on learning Kanji and then learn vocabulary to improve your Japanese.
        Regular practice: First, you must set specific goals for learning Japanese. From there it will be easier for you to create an effective study plan.

        <p style="text-indent:50px; font-size: 17px;">Step 1: Learn the Japanese alphabet and pronunciation
            The Japanese alphabet is three writing systems that work together. The names of these three alphabets are Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Don't worry if it seems overwhelming. If you plan to visit Japan or want to learn the basics of Japanese, knowing Hiragana and Katakana would be very helpful. Kanji is a little more challenging to learn. Let’s learn together about the Japanese alphabet from A to Z!
            1. Hiragana:Hiragana is the foundation of learning Japanese. You can learn the fundamentals of Japanese pronunciation with it. There are a total of 46 basic Hiragana in this Japanese alphabet. All start with 5 basic vowels a-i-u-e-o and the rest are just those 5 vowels with a consonant to form a new syllable. For example the second row with “K” consonants we have 5 new Hiragana Ka-Ki-Ku-Ke-Ko or with “T” we got Ta-Chi-Tsu-Te-To, and so on."
            step1 table hiragana
            2. Katakana:Compared to Hiragana, Katakana is used for non-Japanese or loanwords: a word adopted from a foreign language. The Katakana character set conveniently includes the same sounds as Hiragana. Some of the characters even look a bit similar, like ‘mo’ – も and モ – and ‘ya’ – や and ヤ.

    <p style="text-indent:50px; font-size: 19px;">The best way to learn Japanese is to start with the basics: 
        learning the alphabet. There are 3 basic writing systems you need to learn to be able to read Japanese: Hiragana,
         Katakana, and Kanji.<p>

        <p style="text-indent:50px; font-size: 19px;"> The ability to read Hiragana is crucial for all beginners. Hiragana is primarily used for native Japanese words and consists of 46 characters or 51 phonetic characters. 
            It’s the key to understanding how and why Japanese words sound the way they do. Because most of the characters have only one 
            pronunciation, Hiragana is quite easy to learn. No doubt, once you learn Hiragana,
             you’ll create a firm foundation needed for a native-sounding accent.</p></td>

            <p style="text-indent:50px; font-size: 19px;"> Сompared to Hiragana, Katakana is used for non-Japanese or loanwords: a word adopted from a foreign language. These include technical and scientific terms,
                 as well as the names of some plants and animals.  Katakana can give you more trouble than Hiragana as it won’t be so frequently used, especially at the very beginning of your language learning journey. As your level increases,
                 Katakana will appear more regularly. However, just being able to read Katakana is enough for a beginner.</p></td>

                <p style="text-indent:50px; font-size: 19px;"> Many learners believe that learning Kanji is the most challenging part of the process. On the other hand, it’s one of the most critical aspects of learning Japanese.
                     Knowing very basic Kanji will enable you to understand, speak and write simple Japanese. Kanji consists of thousands of Chinese symbols that represent entire words, ideas or phrases.
                     Kanji comes with many complexities, as English meanings can’t always be directly translated from Japanese words. 
                     That’s why there can be many correct English meanings for a single Kanji word. We never said learning Japanese would be easy, but learning Kanji will give you a huge amount of ways to express yourself.
